# PINN models for the Harmonic Oscillator

This folder contains Python code examples for solving the Harmonic Oscillator problem using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). There are three different implementations provided: 

- `Harmonic oscillator TORCH.ipynb`: A PINN implementation using PyTorch.
- `Harmonic oscillator FLAX.ipynb`: A PINN implementation using JAX and FLAX.
- `Harmonic oscillator EQUINOX.ipynb`: A PINN implementation using JAX and Equinox.

## Requirements

To run the code examples, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Please check the instuctions from the README.md file in the parent directory for setting up the Python environment.
